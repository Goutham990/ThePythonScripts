The problem asks us to find the number of odd-length subarrays within a given efficiency array such that the median of each subarray is equal to efficiency[k].

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

Input:

n: The number of employees (elements in the efficiency array).
efficiency[n]: An array representing the efficiency scores of employees.
k: An integer representing the index of the reference employee. The median value we are looking for is efficiency[k]. (Note: k is 1-indexed in the problem description, but typically 0-indexed in programming. We should clarify this or assume 0-indexed for implementation). The example uses k=4 and efficiency[4]=4, implying a 1-indexed k. For coding, it's safer to convert it to 0-indexed: k-1.
Subarray: A sequence of consecutive elements in the array.

Median of an odd-length array: For an odd-length array of size L, the median is the (L+1)/2-th element after sorting the subarray in non-decreasing order.

Constraints:

efficiency[k] occurs only once in the array.
1≤n≤3×10 
5
 
1≤efficiency[i]≤10 
9
 
1≤k≤n
Example:

efficiency = [5, 3, 1, 4, 7], k = 4 (so efficiency[3] or efficiency[k-1] if 0-indexed, which is 4).
The problem states there are 4 odd-length subarrays with 4 as their median.
